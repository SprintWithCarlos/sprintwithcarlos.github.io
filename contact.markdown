After 10 years of career as a lawyer, I decided that I wanted to be in charge of a company, in direct contact with clients, understanding their needs and generating value for them. So in 2013 I decided to turn my life around
and now I dedicate myself to what I like the most: to create solutions for the real problems and needs of my clients, solutions that are technically feasible and financially viable. Programming started as a hobby, now it
is integrated into my professional activity and facilitates the generation of solutions related to digital transformation
